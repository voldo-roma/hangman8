"No name in the world is more fitting than the one bestowed upon the game of Hangman, which originated in Europe during the 17th century, and was “played” when a prisoner facing death demanded the “Rite of Words and Life.”
The prisoner was strung up over a 5–legged stand, then a blank word would be presented by the executioner. With each incorrect guess, a leg would be knocked away. If the word was guessed correctly, the prisoner would be set free, if not, once all 5 legs were chopped, he would hang. This “game” definitely had dark beginnings, but in time, has grown to a much more fun-loving game kids of all ages."
